# Guess the Number Game

## Introduction
This simple Dart program, created by Ammar Al Hasani, is a part of the mobile app development curriculum at Code Academy Oman. The task was assigned by our esteemed course instructor, Eslam Fareed. The program implements a basic "Guess the Number" game, showcasing foundational concepts of programming using Dart.

## Game Description
The "Guess the Number" game is a classic number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly chosen number within a given range. In this implementation, the range is set between 0 and 20. The program generates a random number within this range, and the player is prompted to input their guess. The program then provides feedback to the player based on their guess, guiding them to the correct answer.

## How to Play
1. Run the Dart program in a suitable environment that supports Dart execution.

2. Upon running the program, you will see the message "Welcome to guess the number game" along with an instruction to "Guess the Number from 0 to 20."

3. Enter your guess as an integer when prompted.

4. Based on your guess, you will receive one of the following messages:
   - If your guess is correct, you will be congratulated, and the correct number will be revealed.
   - If your guess is too low, you will be prompted to try again and increase your guess.
   - If your guess is too high, you will be prompted to try again and decrease your guess.
   - If your input is not within the valid range (0 to 20), you will be informed that the input is out of range.

5. The game continues until you successfully guess the correct number. Upon a successful guess, the game will end.
